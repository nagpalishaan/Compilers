The solutions should be in the respective subdirectory: A0, A1, ...

In each of these subdirectories, it should be possible to build and test your solution using the command

```.gradlew test```

For downloading examples, like CalcParse.zip, etc., place them in sibling directories and don't include them in the committed code.

Don't commit binary files like .jar, .zip, or .class or .pdf files.

The file .gitignore contains rules for files that should be ignored by git, i.e., not committed to the repository. Feel free to edit it if more files should be ignored.
